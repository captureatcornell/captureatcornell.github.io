# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **please do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 1

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

The audience of this site are students of Cornell and those interested in learning more about the club. This tends to be photographers and videographers, as well as members and individuals of other clubs or organizations looking to collab with our club. Site visitors likely want to learn more about the club and understand what the club has to offer.

### Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

Goal 1: To learn more about Capture at Cornell - it's past and present offerings, what they do, if they want to join.

Goal 2: To join the club by filling out the quick form, or to contact the e-board.

Goal 3: To collab with the club by filling out the form.

## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- A carousel of photos showing off the club g-bodys
- E-board grid which shows all the images, and clicking an individual expands their bio.
- An e-board carousel that works in a similar way to the grid
- A hamburger menu that slides away or persists.
- A purely decorational camera that flashes when clicked.
- The C@C logo spins when hovered.

### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

TODO: idea sketches


### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

TODO: final sketch(es)


### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (3-5 sentences)

TODO: design rationale


## Interactivity Implementation Plan (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Planning Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.

TODO: planning sketches


### Interactivity Pseudocode Plan (Milestone 1)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Please do not put JavaScript code here.

```
TODO: pseudocode
```


### "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation (Milestone 1)
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.
> This should be a few sentences. (1-3 sentences)

TODO: ambitious justification


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a large paragraph (4-6 sentences)

TODO: interactivity rationale


### Tell Us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

TODO: what should we grade


### Collaborators (Final Submission)
> List any persons you collaborated with on this project.

TODO: list your collaborators


### Reference Resources (Final Submission)
> Please cite any external resources you referenced in the creation of your project.
> (i.e. W3Schools, StackOverflow, Mozilla, etc.)

TODO: list reference resources


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

TODO: self-reflection


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!
