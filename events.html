    <h2>G-Body Meetings</h2>
    <p>G-body meetings are held every Thursday at 5:30 pm in Rockefeller 132. G-bodies are optional and are recommended
      if
      you are interested in this club but don't know where to start!</p>

    <p>G-bodies tend to have a instructional and social component. Over the hour, there will be a slideshow or "lecture"
      about some aspect of photography or videography. After, members are encouraged to work together to apply the new
      skills, socialize, and ask questions. An optional photo critique is held afterwards. Any member may submit work,
      any
      member may observe and comment. </p>

    <p><em>Critiques are meant to be constructive; any comments or remarks not within the guidelines of the Constitution
        are not allowed. Repeat offense may lead to action. </em></p>
