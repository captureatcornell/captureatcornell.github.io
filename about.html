  <h1>About</h1>
  <em>No dues, no interviews, no hazing!</em>
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>Capture at Cornell was founded by Ming DeMers, Shihao Cao, and Travis Zhang in Spring of 2022. A chance moment on a
    particular wintery day at Libe Slope brought them together. They started with the idea for a community of
    photographers and videographers who could support each other, explore, and grow. Since the beginning, the club has
    aimed to be inclusive and open to all. The three quickly worked to craft a Constitution and structure of their club.
    For Spring Club Fest, C@C occupied a vacant table with their photography gear splayed out. Over 90 members signed up
    that day.</p>

  <p>Since, C@C has striven to provide opportunities to its g-body entirely free of charge. There have been numerous
    collabs with other clubs and external organizations. Photographers have met at photowalks, sharpened their skills at
    workshops, and get professional experience at collabs. Videographers have been to dance competitions, flown drones,
    and worked together on edits for the club.</p>
