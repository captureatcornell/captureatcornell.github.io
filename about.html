        <div>
          <p>
            Since 1982, the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival hosts apples, baked goods, family entertainment, games,
            prizes,
            live entertainment and more. Over 100 talented artists, crafters, bakers, and makers come together for the
            Apple
            Harvest Craft Fair! Find creative, unique works from clothing to woodworking, ceramics to paintings, fudge
            to
            essential oils and beyond throughout the festival. The festival is held in the Ithaca Commons, a few
            streets
            that are full of restaurants and shops.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>How much money should I bring?</strong>

        Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if anything,
        you
        wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the parking garage (You
        can
        find more parking information here ). If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least
        $10.
        Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can
        be
        found here.
      </p>

      <p> <strong>Can I pay with a credit card?</strong>

        Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are interested
        in
        does not accept them.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I bring my dog?</strong>

        Bringing a dog is strongly discouraged due to pets not being allowed on the Commons. Additionally, the event
        will
        be
        crowded and may be overwhelming for your furry friend, or it may be difficult to move through the crowds.
        Registered
        service animals are permitted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What should I wear?</strong>If you are not familiar with the Ithaca area, it can get quite cold in the
        fall!
        Check the weather and bring layers.
      </p>
      <div class="content-section">
        <p><strong>When is the best time to attend?</strong>If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday
          Friday
          is
          a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the
          festival.
